# Ethereum Smart Contract Interaction Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment and interaction with a simple Ethereum smart contract named `Demo.sol`. The smart contract is written in Solidity and includes basic functionalities such as changing and displaying a name, as well as emitting an event.

## Smart Contract Details

### Contract Address
The deployed contract address: [0xD83BC647A3C58A34a37033d504e868a96327eDff](replace_with_actual_contract_address)

## Deployment

The deployment script (`deploy.js`) uses Infura as the Ethereum node provider and deploys the `Demo` contract to the specified network. The contract's ABI and bytecode are loaded from the `Demo.json` file.

### Configuration
- ETHEREUM_NETWORK: Ethereum network
- INFURA_API_KEY: Infura API key for Ethereum node access.
- SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY: Private key of the account used for deployment and interaction.
